/**
 * A utility [Composable] function for collecting one-time events from a [Flow] in a lifecycle-aware manner.
 *
 * One-time events refer to actions that should occur only once â€” for example:
 * - Showing a toast or snackbar
 * - Navigating to another screen after login
 * - Displaying dialogs
 *
 * These events are usually emitted by the ViewModel and **should not be re-triggered** during configuration changes
 * (like screen rotation), unlike persistent UI state. To avoid event loss or accidental re-execution,
 * this function leverages [repeatOnLifecycle] and collects only when the lifecycle is at least in [Lifecycle.State.STARTED].
 *
 * Internally, this uses [LaunchedEffect] and collects the flow on [Dispatchers.Main.immediate] to ensure minimal delay
 * between UI state changes and event handling, avoiding edge cases where events could otherwise be lost
 * if emitted while the lifecycle is in a non-active state (e.g., `DESTROYED` during rotation).
 *
 * @param flow The [Flow] of one-time events to observe.
 * @param key1 An optional key that will trigger re-execution of the [LaunchedEffect] when it changes.
 * @param key2 An optional second key for additional recomposition triggers.
 * @param onEvent A lambda to handle each emitted event from the [Flow].
